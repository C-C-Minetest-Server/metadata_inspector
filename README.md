# What metadata do nodes have?
With this tool, you can view or edit the metadata stored inside nodes, which can be used to modify node ownership, or set custom infotext. Only nodes not protected or owned by the player can be modified, though admins can always do so.

Currently, if in Minetest Game, a brighten stick texture will be used. Otherwise, none will be applied and the default "notexture" texture will be used instead.
